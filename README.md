# react-native-firebase-styled-components
Starter kit for react native integrated with firebase and styled components.

For easy follow through, I will be commiting all changes separately. 
1) First commit is just to get the ball rolling for the reactive native app using expo.
2) In second commit, I will show how to integrate the app with firebase firestore DB.
3) Third commit will be integrating with styled components to support theme.

Stay tuned.
